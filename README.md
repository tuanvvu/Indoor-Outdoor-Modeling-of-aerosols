## Loss processes affecting submicrometre particles in a house heavily affected by road traffic emissions

To understanding better the behavior of traffic particles when they enter into indoor environments, this work conducted measurements of both indoor and outdoor particle number size distributions in a house close to high traffic flows. 
The objective of this study was to investigate the indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios of particle number and factors which determine these ratios. 
In addition, this study quantified the physical loss processes affecting the behaviour of traffic particles in the indoor environment. 
The behaviour of particles when they entered into a flat were modelled by a mass balance model with fully consideration of coagulation, evaporation and deposition process.
Furthermore, we applied the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model to estimate the loss of indoor particles of different outdoor origins.
